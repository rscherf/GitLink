v1.0.0 (2025-12-29)
===================

## Breaking changes

- Our settings location has moved. If you use the "commithash"
  revision type, run "Preferences: GitLink Settings" to configure
  it with the instructions there.


## User-facing changes

This update adds a settings file for customization:

- The existing "revision type" setting has moved. See above.

- You can set arbitrary domains to use URL patterns for a known Git
  service provider. This is helpful for self-hosted apps.

- You can also configure your own URL patterns. (Please upstream if
  you feel they would be useful to others!)

- You can override the default patterns if you choose, but you will
  then no longer receive updates from new versions.


## Under the hood

- The Git service providers were extracted to settings.

- The main Python file has been moved.

- CI now reports test coverage; it's 90%
