v0.13.0 (2025-12-21)
====================

## User-facing changes

- New Git service provider support for
    + Codeberg/Forgejo
    + Sourcehut
    + Gitea
    + Gitee
    + CGit

- Uses source view for "line" links, even if your host shows a
  rendered file (Markdown, SVG, etc.) on the following sites:
    + GitHub
    + GitLab
    + Codeberg/Forgejo
    + Gitea

- Fixes GitLab nested group-owned repositories


## Under the hood

- A pretty big refactor.

- Regression tests for link generation.

- Basic tests for clipboard access.

- GitHub Actions CI for those tests.

If your repo is broken, please file an issue. With the tests, we
should be able to make sure it doesn't break again in the future.


## Coming soon

If you use the commit hash mode in settings, you may have to move
it to a different settings file in 1.0.
