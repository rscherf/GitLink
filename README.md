# GithubLink
Sublime Text 2 plugin to derive <http://github.com> URLs to files in your project. No more traversing your file structure finding the file you are working on.

## How it works

![Right click in side menu](http://f.cl.ly/items/1O100K122E0a1x0y3V1k/Screen%20Shot%202014-10-20%20at%209.46.38%20AM.png)
![Right click in a file](http://f.cl.ly/items/3f1r0h0q1t2J003M2W0A/Screen%20Shot%202014-10-20%20at%209.46.24%20AM.png)

#### Copy URLs to files

`command + shift + c` Right click any file in the sidebar (that is part of a Github.com repository) and go to the `GithubLink` menu item to see options. 

#### Copy URLs to files with a deeplink the line number

Right click anywhere within the file you are currently editing. Your cursor position determines which line number will be used for the deeplink.

#### Open Github.com URLs in your default browser as a new tab

`command + shift + o` Use your default web browser (Chrome) to skip a step and open any of the links automatically in a new tab.
